# Progress: Bayswater Laravel Application

**Current Status:** Initial project setup and environment configuration. Memory Bank initialized. Puppeteer MCP server configured and tested.

**What Works:**
- Basic Laravel application structure is present.
- Memory Bank files created and updated.
- Puppeteer MCP server (`github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/puppeteer`) successfully configured using `cmd.exe /c npx.cmd` in `cline_mcp_settings.json`.
- Puppeteer server connection confirmed.
- Basic Puppeteer functionality tested (`puppeteer_navigate`).

**What's Left to Build:**
- Define and implement specific application features outlined in `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.
- Utilize the Puppeteer MCP server for relevant tasks if needed.

**Known Issues:**
- None currently identified related to the core application or configured MCP servers.

**Evolution of Decisions:**
- Initial focus was on setting up the development environment.
- Successfully installed and configured the Puppeteer MCP server after troubleshooting execution errors (`ENOENT`, `EINVAL`) on Windows by adjusting the command in the MCP settings file.

# Active Context: Puppeteer MCP Server Setup

**Current Focus:** Successfully configured and tested the Puppeteer MCP server.

**Recent Changes:**
- Task received to install the Puppeteer MCP server from `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/puppeteer`.
- Attempted to create directory `C:\Users\ksaak\Documents\Cline\MCP\puppeteer-server`, found it already existed.
- Configured the server in `cline_mcp_settings.json` using the NPX method.
- Encountered `spawn npx ENOENT` error, indicating `npx` was not found.
- Updated configuration to use `npx.cmd`.
- Encountered `spawn EINVAL` error.
- Updated configuration to use `cmd.exe /c npx.cmd`.
- Confirmed successful connection of the Puppeteer MCP server.
- Demonstrated functionality by using `puppeteer_navigate` to open `https://example.com`.

**Next Steps:**
1. Update `progress.md` to reflect the successful setup.
2. Complete the current task.

**Decisions:**
- Used `cmd.exe /c npx.cmd` in the MCP configuration to resolve execution issues on Windows.

**Learnings:**
- MCP server setup on Windows using NPX might require specific command invocation (`npx.cmd` or `cmd.exe /c npx.cmd`) to resolve `ENOENT` or `EINVAL` errors.
- Iterative troubleshooting by modifying the MCP server command in the settings file is effective.
